      <title>üéÆ The Future of Playstation</title>

    &lt;p&gt;Wired have just published an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-sony-next-gen-console/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; with comments from Playstation lead system architect Mark Cerny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlayStation‚Äôs next-generation console ticks all those boxes, starting with an AMD chip at the heart of the device. (Warning: some alphabet soup follows.) The CPU is based on the third generation of AMD‚Äôs Ryzen line and contains eight cores of the company‚Äôs new 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture. The GPU, a custom variant of Radeon‚Äôs Navi family, will support ray tracing, a technique that models the travel of light to simulate complex interactions in 3D environments. While ray tracing is a staple of Hollywood visual effects and is beginning to worm its way into $10,000 high-end processors, no game console has been able to manage it. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that Sony have decided to use Wired.com as a platform to announce the first details of their next console. I think this is a good move on their part. Moving beyond the typical gaming-press, they have the potential to access a broader audience this way. Smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details of our VR strategy today,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbeyond saying that VR is very important to us and that the current PSVR headset is compatible with the new console.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very shrewd of Sony to continue supporting their first-generation of VR hardware with their next console. This might put people&amp;rsquo;s mind at ease with their current investment and further investment into software for the current iteration. I think this is also a very strong indication that BC (Backwards Compatibility) with PS4 software is shoe-in for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerny claims that it has a raw bandwidth higher than any SSD available for PCs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing. Super-SSD confirmed for PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it‚Äôs based in part on the PS4‚Äôs architecture, it will also be backward-compatible with games for that console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, BC confirmed also. I&amp;rsquo;m now ready and excited  for a new console generation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‚å®Ô∏é Getting Started with Hugo</title>
      <link>https://downandoutput.com/posts/hugo-tut-one/</link>

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this three-part series, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in setting up a simple blog like the one you&amp;rsquo;re on right now, and show you how to host it for free on Github Pages. When I began on this journey myself, I had close to zero experience with Github. I followed some of the available guides already out there on the web, (including those from Hugo themselves), but there were some parts that didn‚Äôt quite click with me right away and it relied upon a lot of time and trial &amp;amp; error before it all finally worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, I will assume you have close-to-zero experience with setting up websites or with Github, but by the end, I hope you will understand exactly how to work with Hugo, and understanding more clearly some of the broader concepts in using Git, and then finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to customise your site, and create the workflow for pushing content out to your blog in a quick &amp;amp; efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This guide is written from the perspective of a Mac user, but the general workflow should be the same across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hugo&#34;&gt;Why Hugo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always wanted to write my own blog since the early days of the internet, but none of the available platforms appealed to me. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use a &amp;ldquo;pre-rolled&amp;rdquo; solution like Blogger.com due to lack of customisation and Wordpress just felt &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;. What I always needed and wanted was something in between those two extremes and &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; is it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; is a static website generator with theming support as opposed to a dynamic site generator like &lt;em&gt;Wordpress&lt;/em&gt;. This means that instead of your site being generated on-the-fly from a database, all your pages are served as plain HTML and CSS. It also means that your site is delivered to the end-user blazingly fast. I loved the idea of generating static sites again, bringing me back to the earlier days of site creation and that Do-It-Yourself feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did try operating a &lt;em&gt;Wordpress&lt;/em&gt; site on multiple occasions in the past and while it‚Äôs easy to set up, I found the main aspects of its customisation to be utterly incomprehensible and I consider it to be ‚Äî putting it lightly ‚Äî hugely bloated. There are also many costs involved if you want to engage with any of the customisation options available in the form of themes or plugins. Not to mention the costs involved in procuring a domain and hosting of the site, backed by a full-blown database. Due to these factors, my desire to operate a blog actually fell by the wayside for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying for hosting is not something I wanted to do as I‚Äôm not expecting to generate an income from my blog. Instead, it‚Äôs a place for me to gather my thoughts and share some interesting ideas and information. Hosting in general isn‚Äôt cheap for a Wordpress site, even though the software itself is free and open-source, the hosting alone could easily end up costing you hundreds of dollars per year. This immediately puts you under pressure to monetise your blog instead of just focusing on the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found out you can host your static site on Github Pages for free, delivering pages to the user from Github&amp;rsquo;s fast SSDs, I was completely sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed of content delivery to the end user through the use of static is pages is one of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s greatest strengths, and while I&amp;rsquo;m aware that there are numerous plugins available on &lt;em&gt;Wordpress&lt;/em&gt; that aim to pre-compile pages for faster delivery &amp;ndash; and this is a very valid point in favour of &lt;em&gt;Wordpress&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; I still never did feel confident in relying upon Wordpress as the foundation for my site. Of course, I may be in the minority here, because Wordpress drives a massive percentage of all the sites across the internet, but for a simple blog like this one, &lt;em&gt;Wordpress&lt;/em&gt; is most certainly &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overkill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, enough about all that, you&amp;rsquo;re probably here because you already know you&amp;rsquo;d like to have a static site, so we&amp;rsquo;ll move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;firstly&#34;&gt;Firstly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Quick Start&lt;/em&gt; guide from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is actually quite good, so much of the information from that guide will be re-iterated here. If you are already comfortable with the Terminal or already have your Hugo site set up, you may not need this part of the tutorial at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, the very first thing you want to do is open up your Terminal (AKA CLI). You can do this by pressing &lt;code&gt;cmd + space&lt;/code&gt; on your keyboard to bring up Spotlight Search, and begin typing &lt;code&gt;terminal&lt;/code&gt;. When the application shows, just press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; and up pops the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Terminal Window&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Terminal Window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in why my Terminal may look slightly differently to yours, please refer to the &lt;em&gt;bonus tip&lt;/em&gt; at the end of the article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://downandoutput.com/posts/terminal-tutorial/&#34;&gt;Terminal Navigation 101&lt;/a&gt;. You will also find some other hints and tips for getting started with Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in Hugo is done through the Terminal (AKA CLI), so it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get yourself familiarised with this application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-install-homebrew-hugo&#34;&gt;1. Install Homebrew &amp;amp; Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Hugo, you first need to install a package manager. &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homebrew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the name of the package manager we&amp;rsquo;re using here. Just copy and paste the following code into Terminal&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;/usr/bin/ruby -e &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; to begin installation, and wait for the installation to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that&amp;rsquo;s done, it&amp;rsquo;s time to install Hugo. This is done by typing the following into Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;brew install hugo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-create-your-site&#34;&gt;2. Create Your Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to assume you&amp;rsquo;re in your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; directory, but if you want to create your site elsewhere, just navigate there. Again, you can refer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://downandoutput.com/posts/terminal-tutorial/&#34;&gt;Terminal Navigation 101&lt;/a&gt; to understand this better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new site called &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; (you can call it whatever you want) just enter this command into Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;hugo new site blog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, your new site is created. Now, if you navigate to your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; folder in &lt;code&gt;Finder&lt;/code&gt;, you will see a new folder called &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; there. This is where all the code and files of your site resides.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;New Site Folder&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;New Site Folder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is just a raw template for your site right now, and [in theory] if you go to the site in your browser, you&amp;rsquo;ll see nothing but a blank page. So, you need to add a theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-add-a-theme&#34;&gt;3. Add a Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a theme, you first need to visit the following website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;themes.gohugo.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you find the theme you want to use, you need to copy the &lt;code&gt;Download&lt;/code&gt; URL from the &lt;code&gt;Download&lt;/code&gt; button on the theme&amp;rsquo;s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/&#34;&gt;Hermit&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ &amp;lt; figure src=&amp;ldquo;./img/hugo_theme.png&amp;rdquo; alt=&amp;ldquo;Hermit Theme&amp;rdquo; position=&amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo; style=&amp;ldquo;border-radius: 8px; &amp;ldquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Hermit Theme&amp;rdquo; captionPosition=&amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo; captionStyle=&amp;ldquo;color: white;&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The URL from the &lt;code&gt;Download&lt;/code&gt; button is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This URL ends in &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;. This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got this URL, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;blog/&lt;/code&gt; directory you just created by using this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;cd blog/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes your first interaction with &lt;em&gt;Git&lt;/em&gt; through the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Recent versions of macOS have an Apple fork of Git already installed as standard. If your installation doesn&amp;rsquo;t have this, type &lt;code&gt;brew install git&lt;/code&gt; and wait for the installation to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type into Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git themes/hermit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these two commands are doing is first initialising a local Git respository based on your &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; folder and then you&amp;rsquo;re adding a &amp;ldquo;submodule&amp;rdquo; of the theme into your &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; folder. A submodule is Git&amp;rsquo;s way of creating a copy of a respository within another respository, which in this case, is your site folder: &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt;. This makes it very easy for you to keep the theme up to date by updating the submodule, but what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here now is just taking an &lt;em&gt;image&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;clone&lt;/em&gt; of your chosen theme and copying it into your &lt;code&gt;/themes/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step in using this theme is by following the instructions in the &lt;code&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; file included with the theme you just downloaded. Every theme will include a &lt;code&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; file with basic installation instructions, and this theme is no different. You&amp;rsquo;re asked to copy the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; from the theme&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt; folder into the root of your Hugo site. You can do this manually through &lt;code&gt;Finder&lt;/code&gt; or just simply use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;cp themes/hermit/exampleSite/config.toml .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: Be sure you copy the whole command, including the &lt;code&gt;space + .&lt;/code&gt; at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; is where you configure your site&amp;rsquo;s title, copyright information, etc. This last command will replace the default &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file with the custom one from the theme. You could take a look inside this file right now, and make your own customisations, but I recommend doing that later, once you&amp;rsquo;re finished with this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-create-a-post&#34;&gt;4. Create a Post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can quickly create a new post for your blog through the CLI by using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a file called &lt;code&gt;my-first-post.md&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/blog/content/posts/&lt;/code&gt; and is your actual blog post. You can edit this file with any regular text editor, such as &lt;code&gt;TextEdit&lt;/code&gt;.
All the custom content you create for your site will reside in this &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file extension means this is a &lt;em&gt;markdown&lt;/em&gt; file. Markdown is a very simple and lightweight markup language that easily lets you format your blog posts with very minimal syntax, through any plain text editor. &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; uses markdown extensively to format your posts. Getting into markdown is beyond the scope of this article, but there are many guides elsewhere online for you to learn markdown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&#34;&gt;Markdown Cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; is one such example for a quick reference on markdown. The standard-bearing documentation at &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; is also highly recommended reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-start-the-hugo-server&#34;&gt;5. Start the Hugo Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start the &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; server by using the following command in Terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;hugo server -D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; option means the server will also show any draft posts you may be writing. In this case, &lt;code&gt;my-first-post.md&lt;/code&gt; is a draft. If you look at the top of your &lt;code&gt;my-first-post.md&lt;/code&gt; file, you&amp;rsquo;ll see &lt;code&gt;draft: true&lt;/code&gt;, meaning this post has a &lt;em&gt;draft&lt;/em&gt; status. You publish the article by changing &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. If you run the &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; server without &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt;, your draft posts will not show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in your browser, visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;http://localhost:1313/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voil√†, your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; server is always checking your &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; folder for any changes that you make to any files and will update automatically whenever you make those changes. To stop the server at any time, just press &lt;code&gt;ctrl + c&lt;/code&gt; in the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes the first part in our three-part series in getting your site set up in Hugo. In your own time, have a look around the files that came with your theme, edit the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; with your own information, try installing different themes, write a couple of posts, etc. The best way to learn is by having a play around yourself. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll have found creating the site extremely easy, so don&amp;rsquo;t be worried about breaking anything. At this stage, you should be experimenting a little bit and if worse comes to worse, you can start over. Just make sure to protect your &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder, because again, this is where the bulk of your custom content is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back in next time for the next part of this tutorial where we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into exactly how to have your site hosted on GitHub Pages. See you!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In this series, I will assume you have close-to-zero experience with setting up websites or with Github, but by the end, I hope you will understand exactly how to work with Hugo, and understanding more clearly some of the broader concepts in using Git, and then finally, I&rsquo;ll show you how to customise your site, and create the workflow for pushing content out to your blog in a quick &amp; efficient manner.</p>

<p>Note: This guide is written from the perspective of a Mac user, but the general workflow should be the same across all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo?</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve always wanted to write my own blog since the early days of the internet, but none of the available platforms appealed to me. I really didn&rsquo;t want to use a &ldquo;pre-rolled&rdquo; solution like Blogger.com due to lack of customisation and Wordpress just felt <em>too much</em>. What I always needed and wanted was something in between those two extremes and <em>Hugo</em> is it.</p>

<p><em>Hugo</em> is a static website generator with theming support as opposed to a dynamic site generator like <em>Wordpress</em>. This means that instead of your site being generated on-the-fly from a database, all your pages are served as plain HTML and CSS. It also means that your site is delivered to the end-user blazingly fast. I loved the idea of generating static sites again, bringing me back to the earlier days of site creation and that Do-It-Yourself feel.</p>

<p>I did try operating a <em>Wordpress</em> site on multiple occasions in the past and while it‚Äôs easy to set up, I found the main aspects of its customisation to be utterly incomprehensible and I consider it to be ‚Äî putting it lightly ‚Äî hugely bloated. There are also many costs involved if you want to engage with any of the customisation options available in the form of themes or plugins. Not to mention the costs involved in procuring a domain and hosting of the site, backed by a full-blown database. Due to these factors, my desire to operate a blog actually fell by the wayside for a number of years.</p>

<p>Paying for hosting is not something I wanted to do as I‚Äôm not expecting to generate an income from my blog. Instead, it‚Äôs a place for me to gather my thoughts and share some interesting ideas and information. Hosting in general isn‚Äôt cheap for a Wordpress site, even though the software itself is free and open-source, the hosting alone could easily end up costing you hundreds of dollars per year. This immediately puts you under pressure to monetise your blog instead of just focusing on the content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I found out you can host your static site on Github Pages for free, delivering pages to the user from Github&rsquo;s fast SSDs, I was completely sold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speed of content delivery to the end user through the use of static is pages is one of Hugo&rsquo;s greatest strengths, and while I&rsquo;m aware that there are numerous plugins available on <em>Wordpress</em> that aim to pre-compile pages for faster delivery &ndash; and this is a very valid point in favour of <em>Wordpress</em>&ndash; I still never did feel confident in relying upon Wordpress as the foundation for my site. Of course, I may be in the minority here, because Wordpress drives a massive percentage of all the sites across the internet, but for a simple blog like this one, <em>Wordpress</em> is most certainly <strong><em>overkill</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Well, enough about all that, you&rsquo;re probably here because you already know you&rsquo;d like to have a static site, so we&rsquo;ll move on.</p>

<h2 id="firstly">Firstly</h2>

<p>The <em>Quick Start</em> guide from <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a> is actually quite good, so much of the information from that guide will be re-iterated here. If you are already comfortable with the Terminal or already have your Hugo site set up, you may not need this part of the tutorial at all.</p>

<p>To begin, the very first thing you want to do is open up your Terminal (AKA CLI). You can do this by pressing <code>cmd + space</code> on your keyboard to bring up Spotlight Search, and begin typing <code>terminal</code>. When the application shows, just press <code>enter</code> and up pops the Terminal.</p>

You will also find some other hints and tips for getting started with Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything in Hugo is done through the Terminal (AKA CLI), so it&rsquo;s a good idea to get yourself familiarised with this application.</p>

<h2 id="1-install-homebrew-hugo">1. Install Homebrew &amp; Hugo</h2>

<p>To install Hugo, you first need to install a package manager. <a href="https://brew.sh"><em>Homebrew</em></a> is the name of the package manager we&rsquo;re using here. Just copy and paste the following code into Terminal&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Then press <code>enter</code> to begin installation, and wait for the installation to finish.</p>

<p>When that&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s time to install Hugo. This is done by typing the following into Terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">brew install hugo
</code></pre>

<h2 id="2-create-your-site">2. Create Your Site</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to assume you&rsquo;re in your <code>Home</code> directory, but if you want to create your site elsewhere, just navigate there. Again, you can refer to <a href="http://downandoutput.com/posts/terminal-tutorial/">Terminal Navigation 101</a> to understand this better.</p>

<p>To create a new site called &ldquo;blog&rdquo; (you can call it whatever you want) just enter this command into Terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">hugo new site blog
</code></pre>

<p>And just like that, your new site is created. Now, if you navigate to your <code>Home</code> folder in <code>Finder</code>, you will see a new folder called &ldquo;blog&rdquo; there. This is where all the code and files of your site resides.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/2.png"  alt="New Site Folder"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >New Site Folder</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>This is just a raw template for your site right now, and [in theory] if you go to the site in your browser, you&rsquo;ll see nothing but a blank page. So, you need to add a theme.</p>

<h2 id="3-add-a-theme">3. Add a Theme</h2>

<p>To add a theme, you first need to visit the following website: <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">themes.gohugo.io</a></p>

<p>Once you find the theme you want to use, you need to copy the <code>Download</code> URL from the <code>Download</code> button on the theme&rsquo;s homepage.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll use the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/">Hermit</a> theme.</p>

<p>{{ &lt; figure src=&ldquo;./img/hugo_theme.png&rdquo; alt=&ldquo;Hermit Theme&rdquo; position=&ldquo;center&rdquo; style=&ldquo;border-radius: 8px; &ldquo; caption=&ldquo;Hermit Theme&rdquo; captionPosition=&ldquo;center&rdquo; captionStyle=&ldquo;color: white;&rdquo; &gt; }}</p>

<p>The URL from the <code>Download</code> button is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: This URL ends in <code>.git</code>. This is important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got this URL, <code>cd</code> into the <code>blog/</code> directory you just created by using this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">cd blog/
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes your first interaction with <em>Git</em> through the command line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Recent versions of macOS have an Apple fork of Git already installed as standard. If your installation doesn&rsquo;t have this, type <code>brew install git</code> and wait for the installation to finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type into Terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">git init
</code></pre>

<p>and press <code>enter</code>.</p>

<p>Next, type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">git submodule add https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git themes/hermit
</code></pre>

<p>What these two commands are doing is first initialising a local Git respository based on your <code>blog</code> folder and then you&rsquo;re adding a &ldquo;submodule&rdquo; of the theme into your <code>themes</code> folder. A submodule is Git&rsquo;s way of creating a copy of a respository within another respository, which in this case, is your site folder: <code>blog</code>. This makes it very easy for you to keep the theme up to date by updating the submodule, but what we&rsquo;re doing here now is just taking an <em>image</em> or <em>clone</em> of your chosen theme and copying it into your <code>/themes/</code> folder.</p>

<p>The final step in using this theme is by following the instructions in the <code>readme.md</code> file included with the theme you just downloaded. Every theme will include a <code>readme.md</code> file with basic installation instructions, and this theme is no different. You&rsquo;re asked to copy the <code>config.toml</code> from the theme&rsquo;s <code>exampleSite</code> folder into the root of your Hugo site. You can do this manually through <code>Finder</code> or just simply use the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">cp themes/hermit/exampleSite/config.toml .
</code></pre>

<p>NB: Be sure you copy the whole command, including the <code>space + .</code> at the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>config.toml</code> is where you configure your site&rsquo;s title, copyright information, etc. This last command will replace the default <code>config.toml</code> file with the custom one from the theme. You could take a look inside this file right now, and make your own customisations, but I recommend doing that later, once you&rsquo;re finished with this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="4-create-a-post">4. Create a Post</h2>

<p>You can quickly create a new post for your blog through the CLI by using the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a file called <code>my-first-post.md</code> in <code>/blog/content/posts/</code> and is your actual blog post. You can edit this file with any regular text editor, such as <code>TextEdit</code>.
All the custom content you create for your site will reside in this <code>content</code> folder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>.md</code> file extension means this is a <em>markdown</em> file. Markdown is a very simple and lightweight markup language that easily lets you format your blog posts with very minimal syntax, through any plain text editor. <em>Hugo</em> uses markdown extensively to format your posts. Getting into markdown is beyond the scope of this article, but there are many guides elsewhere online for you to learn markdown. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown Cheatsheet</a> is one such example for a quick reference on markdown. The standard-bearing documentation at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Daring Fireball</a> is also highly recommended reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="5-start-the-hugo-server">5. Start the Hugo Server</h2>

<p>You start the <em>Hugo</em> server by using the following command in Terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">hugo server -D
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>-D</code> option means the server will also show any draft posts you may be writing. In this case, <code>my-first-post.md</code> is a draft. If you look at the top of your <code>my-first-post.md</code> file, you&rsquo;ll see <code>draft: true</code>, meaning this post has a <em>draft</em> status. You publish the article by changing <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>. If you run the <em>Hugo</em> server without <code>-D</code>, your draft posts will not show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, in your browser, visit:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">http://localhost:1313/
</code></pre>

<p>Voil√†, your site.</p>

<p><em>Hugo</em> server is always checking your <code>blog</code> folder for any changes that you make to any files and will update automatically whenever you make those changes. To stop the server at any time, just press <code>ctrl + c</code> in the Terminal.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This concludes the first part in our three-part series in getting your site set up in Hugo. In your own time, have a look around the files that came with your theme, edit the <code>config.toml</code> with your own information, try installing different themes, write a couple of posts, etc. The best way to learn is by having a play around yourself. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have found creating the site extremely easy, so don&rsquo;t be worried about breaking anything. At this stage, you should be experimenting a little bit and if worse comes to worse, you can start over. Just make sure to protect your <code>content</code> folder, because again, this is where the bulk of your custom content is.</p>

<p>Check back in next time for the next part of this tutorial where we&rsquo;ll delve into exactly how to have your site hosted on GitHub Pages. See you!</p>

&lt;p&gt;The Terminal, (AKA &lt;code&gt;CLI&lt;/code&gt;, or &amp;ldquo;Command-Line Interface&amp;rdquo;) is super-powerful and allows you to interface directly with the underlying workings of your operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty essential you learn how to use the Terminal if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be developing software or doing any more advanced operations within your operating system as many operations are done exclusively through the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a quick run-down on how to navigate your file system in Terminal. At the end, there is a bonus tip for altering the appearance of your Terminal to make things more efficient for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-terminal&#34;&gt;Opening Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find Terminal by going to your &lt;code&gt;/Applications/Utilities/&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;em&gt;Finder&lt;/em&gt;.

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/terminal_icon.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Terminal App Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; width: 256px&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Terminal App Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


Alternatively, you can open it by pressing &lt;code&gt;cmd + space&lt;/code&gt; on your keyboard to bring up &lt;em&gt;Spotlight Search&lt;/em&gt;, and begin typing &lt;code&gt;terminal&lt;/code&gt;. When the application shows, just press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; and up pops the Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you open your Terminal, you&amp;rsquo;ll be greeting with a screen similar to this one:

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Terminal Window&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Terminal Window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-components-explained&#34;&gt;Starting Components Explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of input prompt, before the colon, is your computer&amp;rsquo;s name. This can be changed to whatever you want in &lt;code&gt;System Preferences &amp;gt; Sharing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Computer Name&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Computer Name&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tilde (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) represents your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Home Directory&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Home Directory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, the part before the dollar sign (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;) is the name of the user account you&amp;rsquo;re logged in as.

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;User Name&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;User Name&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;navigating-terminal&#34;&gt;Navigating Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You perform actions in Terminal by inputting a command and pressing &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt;. Here, I will go through the basics of navigating Terminal with some of the most common commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by typing &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; into Terminal and pressing &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt;.

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/ls.png&#34;  alt=&#34;ls command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;ls command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; is the command for &amp;ldquo;listing directory contents&amp;rdquo;. As you are in your home directory, the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command will show you all the directories inside of your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s move into one of the folders. You do this with the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command. Simple type &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; and the folders name, like so:

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/cd.png&#34;  alt=&#34;cd command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;cd command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a &amp;ldquo;folder&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;directory&amp;rdquo; are not exactly the same thing, please note that in this tutorial, the terms may be used interchangably, and in general, they refer to practically the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see now, instead of being in your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) directory, you&amp;rsquo;re now in your &lt;code&gt;Documents&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/cd_doc.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Documents Directory&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Documents Directory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a new directory inside &lt;code&gt;Documents&lt;/code&gt;, you use the &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a space, followed by the name of the new directory you want to create. In this example, we type &lt;code&gt;mkdir blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/mkdir.png&#34;  alt=&#34;mkdir command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;mkdir command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; now, you see there is a new directory inside of &lt;code&gt;Documents&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/ls_blog.png&#34;  alt=&#34;ls command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;ls command again&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you type &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt; now and press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt;, you can confirm the full path of where you are inside Terminal. &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt; stands for &amp;ldquo;Print Working Directory&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/pwd.png&#34;  alt=&#34;pwd command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;pwd command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To delete the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; directory you just created, you type &lt;code&gt;rm -R&lt;/code&gt; followed by the name of the directory. Confirm the directory is gone by using the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command once again.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/ls_rm.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Empty Directory&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Empty Directory&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful when using the &lt;code&gt;rm -R&lt;/code&gt; command, as this will delete your directory, plus all of its contents&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;for good&lt;/em&gt;, without confirmation. There is no &amp;ldquo;Trash Can&amp;rdquo; in Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt; is what is called an &amp;ldquo;Option&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Switch&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Argument&amp;rdquo;. Commands usually have many Options avialable. To find out more about any command in Terminal, you can do so by typing &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; (for &lt;em&gt;Manual&lt;/em&gt;), followed by the command. This opens up the manual page for the command, where you can read about all the options.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/man.png&#34;  alt=&#34;man command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;man command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exit the manual by pressing &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to move up one directory, just type &lt;code&gt;cd ..&lt;/code&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;ll move up a directory. Alternatively, if you want to go back to your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; directory from anywhere, just type &lt;code&gt;cd ~&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/cd_up.png&#34;  alt=&#34;cd .. command&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;cd .. command&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This concludes the basic Terminal Navigation tutorial. Following is a bonus tip I promised you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus-terminal-tip&#34;&gt;Bonus Terminal Tip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when you use Terminal, you&amp;rsquo;re presented with this screen, as you saw from the beginning of this tutorial.

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Terminal Window&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Terminal Window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contains unnecessary information when using Terminal on a daily basis, so with a very simple command, you can hide the computer name and username in your Terminal. Producing this instead:

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Minimal Terminal&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Minimal Terminal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;rsquo;d agree, this makes things a lot more tidy for you and removes additional clutter and distraction &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimalist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, simply type (or copy &amp;amp; paste) this command into Terminal and press &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt;. After this, open a new Terminal window by pressing &lt;code&gt;cmd + n&lt;/code&gt; to see your new Terminal prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;echo &amp;quot;export PS1=&#39;\W \$ &#39;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bash_profile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this commands does is it appends the line &lt;code&gt;export PS1&#39;\W \$&#39;&lt;/code&gt; into a hidden system file in your &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; directory called &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;. This file controls what is presented to you when you open a new Terminal window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only barely touching the surface of what can be accomplished in Terminal. As I said before, getting familiar with the Terminal is essential if you&amp;rsquo;re interesting in going deeper into what is possible with your computer. In other words&amp;hellip; becoming a &lt;em&gt;Power User&lt;/em&gt;.  I hope this tutorial can help you in making those first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <![CDATA[

<p>The Terminal, (AKA <code>CLI</code>, or &ldquo;Command-Line Interface&rdquo;) is super-powerful and allows you to interface directly with the underlying workings of your operating system. It&rsquo;s pretty essential you learn how to use the Terminal if you&rsquo;re going to be developing software or doing any more advanced operations within your operating system as many operations are done exclusively through the Terminal.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll give you a quick run-down on how to navigate your file system in Terminal. At the end, there is a bonus tip for altering the appearance of your Terminal to make things more efficient for you.</p>

<h2 id="opening-terminal">Opening Terminal</h2>

<p>You can find Terminal by going to your <code>/Applications/Utilities/</code> directory in <em>Finder</em>.

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/terminal_icon.png"  alt="Terminal App Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px; width: 256px"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Terminal App Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


Alternatively, you can open it by pressing <code>cmd + space</code> on your keyboard to bring up <em>Spotlight Search</em>, and begin typing <code>terminal</code>. When the application shows, just press <code>enter</code> and up pops the Terminal.</p>

<p>When you open your Terminal, you&rsquo;ll be greeting with a screen similar to this one:

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.png"  alt="Terminal Window"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Terminal Window</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<h2 id="starting-components-explained">Starting Components Explained</h2>

<p>The first part of input prompt, before the colon, is your computer&rsquo;s name. This can be changed to whatever you want in <code>System Preferences &gt; Sharing</code>.<br />

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.1.png"  alt="Computer Name"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Computer Name</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<p>The tilde (<code>~</code>) represents your home directory.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.2.png"  alt="Home Directory"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Home Directory</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>And finally, the part before the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) is the name of the user account you&rsquo;re logged in as.

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.3.png"  alt="User Name"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >User Name</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<h2 id="navigating-terminal">Navigating Terminal</h2>

<p>You perform actions in Terminal by inputting a command and pressing <code>enter</code>. Here, I will go through the basics of navigating Terminal with some of the most common commands.</p>

<p>Start by typing <code>ls</code> into Terminal and pressing <code>enter</code>.

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/ls.png"  alt="ls command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >ls command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<code>ls</code> is the command for &ldquo;listing directory contents&rdquo;. As you are in your home directory, the <code>ls</code> command will show you all the directories inside of your <code>Home</code> directory.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move into one of the folders. You do this with the <code>cd</code> command. Simple type <code>cd</code> and the folders name, like so:

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/cd.png"  alt="cd command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >cd command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While a &ldquo;folder&rdquo; and &ldquo;directory&rdquo; are not exactly the same thing, please note that in this tutorial, the terms may be used interchangably, and in general, they refer to practically the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see now, instead of being in your <code>Home</code> (<code>~</code>) directory, you&rsquo;re now in your <code>Documents</code> directory.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/cd_doc.png"  alt="Documents Directory"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Documents Directory</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>If you want to make a new directory inside <code>Documents</code>, you use the <code>mkdir</code>, followed by a space, followed by the name of the new directory you want to create. In this example, we type <code>mkdir blog</code>.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/mkdir.png"  alt="mkdir command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >mkdir command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>If you <code>ls</code> now, you see there is a new directory inside of <code>Documents</code></p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/ls_blog.png"  alt="ls command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >ls command again</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>If you type <code>pwd</code> now and press <code>enter</code>, you can confirm the full path of where you are inside Terminal. <code>pwd</code> stands for &ldquo;Print Working Directory&rdquo;.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/pwd.png"  alt="pwd command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >pwd command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>To delete the <code>blog</code> directory you just created, you type <code>rm -R</code> followed by the name of the directory. Confirm the directory is gone by using the <code>ls</code> command once again.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/ls_rm.png"  alt="Empty Directory"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Empty Directory</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Be careful when using the <code>rm -R</code> command, as this will delete your directory, plus all of its contents&hellip; <em>for good</em>, without confirmation. There is no &ldquo;Trash Can&rdquo; in Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-R</code> is what is called an &ldquo;Option&rdquo;, &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; or &ldquo;Argument&rdquo;. Commands usually have many Options avialable. To find out more about any command in Terminal, you can do so by typing <code>man</code> (for <em>Manual</em>), followed by the command. This opens up the manual page for the command, where you can read about all the options.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/man.png"  alt="man command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >man command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Exit the manual by pressing <code>q</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, to move up one directory, just type <code>cd ..</code> and you&rsquo;ll move up a directory. Alternatively, if you want to go back to your <code>Home</code> directory from anywhere, just type <code>cd ~</code>.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/cd_up.png"  alt="cd .. command"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >cd .. command</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>This concludes the basic Terminal Navigation tutorial. Following is a bonus tip I promised you&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="bonus-terminal-tip">Bonus Terminal Tip</h2>

<p>Normally when you use Terminal, you&rsquo;re presented with this screen, as you saw from the beginning of this tutorial.

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.png"  alt="Terminal Window"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Terminal Window</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<p>This contains unnecessary information when using Terminal on a daily basis, so with a very simple command, you can hide the computer name and username in your Terminal. Producing this instead:

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/2.png"  alt="Minimal Terminal"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Minimal Terminal</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;d agree, this makes things a lot more tidy for you and removes additional clutter and distraction &ndash; <strong><em>Minimalist</em></strong>.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, simply type (or copy &amp; paste) this command into Terminal and press <code>enter</code>. After this, open a new Terminal window by pressing <code>cmd + n</code> to see your new Terminal prompt.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">echo &quot;export PS1='\W \$ '&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>What this commands does is it appends the line <code>export PS1'\W \$'</code> into a hidden system file in your <code>Home</code> directory called <code>.bash_profile</code>. This file controls what is presented to you when you open a new Terminal window.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is only barely touching the surface of what can be accomplished in Terminal. As I said before, getting familiar with the Terminal is essential if you&rsquo;re interesting in going deeper into what is possible with your computer. In other words&hellip; becoming a <em>Power User</em>.  I hope this tutorial can help you in making those first steps.</p>

      <title>‚åò Change macOS Icons</title>
      <link>https://downandoutput.com/posts/change-mac-icons/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2019 11:24:59 +0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://downandoutput.com/posts/change-mac-icons/</guid>
      <description>    
      
        <img src="https://downandoutput.com/posts/change-mac-icons/cover.jpg" class="post-cover" />
      
    

&lt;p&gt;If you ever felt like you&amp;rsquo;d like to customise and change the standard icons of any app, file, or folder on macOS, but you didn&amp;rsquo;t know how, you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place. It&amp;rsquo;s actually very easy, and can be done in just a few very simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You first need to find and download an icon of your choice. I recommend the site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iconarchive.com/&#34;&gt;IconArchive&lt;/a&gt;, they have many high-quality icons. There are a few different icon formats available on the site, but the one you need for Mac is the &lt;code&gt;.icns&lt;/code&gt; format. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got a retina display, I suggest you filter for &lt;em&gt;Large Icons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once its downloaded, place the &lt;code&gt;.icns&lt;/code&gt; file on your desktop, or anywhere easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-begin&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;d like to change the default icon of your Macintosh HD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, the icon looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Default Macintosh HD Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Default Macintosh HD Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And you want to change it to this one, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/robsonbillponte.html&#34;&gt;Robsonbillponte&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/drive.png&#34;  alt=&#34;New Drive Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; width: 256px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;New Drive Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just click once on the drive until it&amp;rsquo;s highlighted, like this:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Highlight HD&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Select the HD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, press &lt;code&gt;cmd(‚åò) + i&lt;/code&gt; on your keyboard. This will open the &lt;em&gt;Info&lt;/em&gt; panel, like so:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Info Panel&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Info Panel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can take your new icon and just just drag and drop it over the default icon at the top of the &lt;em&gt;Info&lt;/em&gt; panel.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/video.gif&#34;  alt=&#34;Drag and Drop New Icon Over Old&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Drag and Drop New Icon Over Old&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;macOS will often prompt you for a password to make the change, so just enter your password, press &lt;em&gt;Enter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;voil√†&lt;/em&gt;, your icon will be changed. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/4.png&#34;  alt=&#34;New Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;New Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can do this with pretty much any file, folder or app across macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reverting-back&#34;&gt;Reverting Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you want to revert back to the original icon, it&amp;rsquo;s also very easy. Just open up the &lt;em&gt;Info&lt;/em&gt; panel again, click the icon at the top, and press the delete key on your keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/video2.gif&#34;  alt=&#34;Highlight and Delete&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; &#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Highlight and Delete&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boom&lt;/strong&gt;, job done!&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="let-s-begin">Let&rsquo;s Begin</h2>

<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;d like to change the default icon of your Macintosh HD.</p>

<p>Normally, the icon looks like this:</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.png"  alt="Default Macintosh HD Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Default Macintosh HD Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>And you want to change it to this one, by <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/robsonbillponte.html">Robsonbillponte</a>:</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/drive.png"  alt="New Drive Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px; width: 256px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >New Drive Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Just click once on the drive until it&rsquo;s highlighted, like this:</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/2.png"  alt="Highlight HD"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Select the HD</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Then, press <code>cmd(‚åò) + i</code> on your keyboard. This will open the <em>Info</em> panel, like so:</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/3.png"  alt="Info Panel"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Info Panel</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Finally, you can take your new icon and just just drag and drop it over the default icon at the top of the <em>Info</em> panel.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/video.gif"  alt="Drag and Drop New Icon Over Old"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Drag and Drop New Icon Over Old</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>macOS will often prompt you for a password to make the change, so just enter your password, press <em>Enter</em> and <em>voil√†</em>, your icon will be changed. Simple.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/4.png"  alt="New Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >New Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>You can do this with pretty much any file, folder or app across macOS.</p>

<h2 id="reverting-back">Reverting Back</h2>

<p>Should you want to revert back to the original icon, it&rsquo;s also very easy. Just open up the <em>Info</em> panel again, click the icon at the top, and press the delete key on your keyboard.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/video2.gif"  alt="Highlight and Delete"   style="border-radius: 8px; "  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Highlight and Delete</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p><strong>Boom</strong>, job done!</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light.&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmann&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hans Hoffman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors‚Ä¶ they&amp;rsquo;re everywhere and all around us, and don‚Äôt you just love them? When designing anything, colors are super important. The color of your fonts and UI elements can give your creations unique personality, character and drive attention towards different aspects of your design. Colors also give designers the ability to subtly draw a users‚Äô focus to a desired element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, I knew I really needed to up my color game, so I started looking into the current color-picking app landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many apps out there today focused on helping designers pick colors and these apps normally have built-in functionality for choosing, picking, storing individual colors and creating or maintaining color palettes. These apps also make it easy for you to export your colors in a variety of usable formats, such as CSS HEX, Swift/NSColor, RGB, CMYK, Android or even Pantone color formats for use in your development environment such as Xcode or your design package of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a table of some of the best color pickers in the macOS app ecosystem today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;App&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Mac App Store?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;$9&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Free (w/ IAP)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Free (w/ IAP)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pikkaapp.com&#34;&gt;Pikka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pikka-color-picker/id1195076754&#34;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;$7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried them all yet, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t an exhaustive list by any stretch of the imagination but in this article, I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight just two of the best color-picking apps I‚Äôve tried recently: &lt;a href=&#34;https://sipapp.io/&#34;&gt;Sip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cusaro.it/aquarelo/&#34;&gt;Aquarelo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sip&#34;&gt;Sip&lt;/h2&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/sip_icon.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Sip App Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; width: 256px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Sip App Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This app has a very nice interface and boasts a wonderful contrast checking feature, I found this feature most interesting and is probably my favourite feature of the app. Input two colors, and the checker will give you a score based on the relative contrast between those two colors.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Check Contrast in Sip&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Check Contrast in Sip&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the contrast of your two colors gets a low score, you can quickly click on ‚ÄúFIX‚Äù and ‚Äî as the button name implies ‚Äî Sip will give you a new color of a similar hue that will increase the contrast for maximum legibility.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/1.1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Sip Magnifier and Color Name&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Sip Magnifier and Color Name&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 id=&#34;aquarelo&#34;&gt;Aquarelo&lt;/h2&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/aqua_icon.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Aquarelo App Icon&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;  width: 256px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Aquarelo App Icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving onto Aquarelo, you can see the interface is very unique, highly minimalist and it reminds me of the color swatches you can pick up at the paint store.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Aquarelo UI&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Aquarelo UI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I would say Aquarelo is the more elegant and beautifully designed of the two, but I think they serve slightly different audiences. I can see Aquarello being very good fit for interior or fashion designers, where you might need a range shades between two colors you have already chosen, whereas Sip perhaps caters more towards the experimental, promoting a freer spirit of mixing and matching.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/2.1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Aquarelo Pantone-esque&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Aquarelo Pantone-esque&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both these apps allow you to export your palettes as HTML files. I put the same palette of colors into both apps and exported it as a demonstration. You can check out the results &lt;a href=&#34;https://downandoutput.com/palette_sip.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (Sip) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://downandoutput.com/palette_aquarello.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (Aquarelo). One thing to note is that both of these apps produced completely different names for the same colors, which might surprise you, but the names are really only used to add character to the colors, as opposed to being reliable indentifiers in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cost-and-trials&#34;&gt;Cost and Trials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costing $10 and $13 respectively, these color apps are useful and beautifully designed, and while I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider them expensive, they are the most expensive of all the premium color pickers that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and it probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to pay for one of these apps unless you know you&amp;rsquo;ll be using it very regularly. To find out for yourself which you might like, it makes sense to download them and try for yourself - Sip has a free trial available from their site, Aquarelo does not, but you can trial both of these apps as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://setapp.com/&#34;&gt;SetApp&lt;/a&gt;. And while Aquarelo is available on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/aquareloapp&#34;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;, Sip is not, available instead exclusively through their own homepage and SetApp. It was through SetApp that I trialled Aquarelo myself while I downloaded Sip as a trial directly from their homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mostly loved everything about both the apps but one complaint I would have about Sip is that I found the high frequency of their reminders to purchase their product and how many days were left of my trial to border on the obnoxious. Every time I logged into my Mac or woke up from sleep, I‚Äôd get a reminder. Sometimes I got these notifications for zero apparent reason, interrupting what I was doing. This got old very quickly and I deleted the app after a small number of days. That&amp;rsquo;s quite a minor complaint though if I were actually using their app on a daily basis, like probably most of their target audience would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I didn‚Äôt stick with either of these apps. I felt that they were a little beyond the scope of my needs. You might feel differently yourself because maybe you‚Äôre a professional full-time designer, or perhaps you work as part of a team or as a design lead, but I am not. I just need a simple way to pick a color every now and again. So in the end, I couldn‚Äôt really justify the cost, and I could do without yet-another icon in my [already-saturated] status bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I was reminded consistently of Apple‚Äôs own built-in Color Picker. This comes as standard in Mac OS X and is itself quite sophisticated. You will have seen it residing inside many other apps you use on a daily basis, such as Apple‚Äôs own software like Pages or Numbers. It should be noted that both Sip and Aquarelo give you an option to open up Apple&amp;rsquo;s built-in color picker from within their respective apps. This is most important for Aquarelo, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have it&amp;rsquo;s own custom color picker tool.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Apple&amp;#39;s Color Picker&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Apple&amp;#39;s Standard Color Picker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Out of all the pickers I&amp;rsquo;ve tested, this one is really my favourite one of all, because it‚Äôs a known quantity and it focuses purely on the task of picking and saving colors very efficiently and effectively. Not only that, it can be extended with extensions, like with this wonderful color picker extension that goes by the name of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bjango.com/mac/skalacolor/&#34;&gt;Skala Color&lt;/a&gt;, made by one of my favourite software houses ‚Äì &lt;a href=&#34;https://bjango.com/&#34;&gt;Bjango&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/4.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Skala Color UI&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Skala Color UI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It too has the ability to export your colors in many formats, as you can see in the following screengrab.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/5.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Skala Color Export Options&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Skala Color Export Options&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Skala Color has a really beautiful, high-precision color picker and does almost everything I need it to do, and the best part of all? It‚Äôs absolutely free.
I must say, Apple Color Picker with the Skala Color extension is really a fantastic combination and this would be my first recommendation to anyone who needs an exceedingly useful [&lt;strong&gt;free!&lt;/strong&gt;] color picker for their development or designing needs. This combination is not really lacking in any way except for being slightly less intuitive than the paid apps, but in terms of functionality: it&amp;rsquo;s all here. Personally, I don‚Äôt really mind just managing my palettes manually in the handy built-in color wells.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/6.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Practically Limitless&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Practically Limitless&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can go a step further and create as many custom palettes as you want. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s not as intuitive or beautiful as the paid apps, but it&amp;rsquo;s more than sufficient. While I usually maintain my color palettes within design apps such as Sketch or Illustrator, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly handy to have them in here so they can be called upon at any time.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/6.1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Custom Palette&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Custom Palette&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To take it further again, you can download more color palettes and add them to Apple&amp;rsquo;s Color Picker. What you need to look for are palette files which carry the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;.clr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; extension and put them into your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/Library/Colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; folder. Then they will be available to you next time you open the color picker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a complete set of Pantone Swatches in mine.

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./img/6.2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Pantone Swatches&#34;   style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;center&#34;  style=&#34;color: white;&#34; &gt;Pantone Swatches&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Pantone palette files were expertly crafted by Midwinter Duncan Grant and can be downloaded from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midwinter-dg.com/resources.html#color-palettes&#34;&gt;Resources page&lt;/a&gt; of his site for free. Midwinter makes available a lot more free goodies beyond color palettes too, so be sure to check out his site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midwinter-dg.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mapdiva.com/&#34;&gt;Mapdiva&lt;/a&gt; also have a list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mapdiva.com/artboard/artb-tutorial/12-custom-color-palettes-for-macos/&#34;&gt;12 Custom Color Palettes&lt;/a&gt; for you to download. I did find some of the links here broken, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good article nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you&amp;rsquo;re specifically a coder and also have in interest in colors, I recommend you take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ethanschoonover.com/&#34;&gt;Ethan Schoonover&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solarized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project. This is a palette of only 16 colours, but they are highly refined, precise and tested extensively for contrast and legibility across many text editors and devices in a variety of lighting conditions. Basically, if you&amp;rsquo;re a coder, you owe it to yourself [and your eyes] to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-last-thing&#34;&gt;One Last Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Apple‚Äôs Color Picker with Bjango&amp;rsquo;s Skala Color, that sounds like a real killer combo, right? Yes, but there is one major caveat: normally, you can only access Apple‚Äôs Color Picker within other apps and not as a standalone app that can be launched like any standard app.
This would seem to limit its function somewhat for picking colors when you‚Äôre browsing the Internet, for example. But fear not, you can easily turn Apple‚Äôs Color Picker into a standalone app that can be accessed and launched at any time, no matter what you‚Äôre doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done through a very simple AppleScript, made with Apple‚Äôs Script Editor, which you can find in the &lt;code&gt;Utilities&lt;/code&gt; folder in your &lt;code&gt;~/Applications&lt;/code&gt; directory. You can follow a very handy guide &lt;a href=&#34;http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Mac OS X Hints&lt;/em&gt; if you need further details, but should you want something even easier, I have gone ahead and made this handy app available for you to download for free. There are two version, one for speakers of British English, and the other in US-English. Just click download below to grab one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icon I used is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iconarchive.com/artist/mcdo-design.html&#34;&gt;Susumu Yoshida&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you enjoy it and find it suitable for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have yourself a wonderfully colorful day!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light.<br />
-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmann"><strong><em>Hans Hoffman</em></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colors‚Ä¶ they&rsquo;re everywhere and all around us, and don‚Äôt you just love them? When designing anything, colors are super important. The color of your fonts and UI elements can give your creations unique personality, character and drive attention towards different aspects of your design. Colors also give designers the ability to subtly draw a users‚Äô focus to a desired element.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, I knew I really needed to up my color game, so I started looking into the current color-picking app landscape.</p>

<p>There are many, many apps out there today focused on helping designers pick colors and these apps normally have built-in functionality for choosing, picking, storing individual colors and creating or maintaining color palettes. These apps also make it easy for you to export your colors in a variety of usable formats, such as CSS HEX, Swift/NSColor, RGB, CMYK, Android or even Pantone color formats for use in your development environment such as Xcode or your design package of choice.</p>

<p>The following is a table of some of the best color pickers in the macOS app ecosystem today:</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried them all yet, and this isn&rsquo;t an exhaustive list by any stretch of the imagination but in this article, I&rsquo;d like to highlight just two of the best color-picking apps I‚Äôve tried recently: <a href="https://sipapp.io/">Sip</a>, and <a href="https://www.cusaro.it/aquarelo/">Aquarelo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sip">Sip</h2>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/sip_icon.png"  alt="Sip App Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px; width: 256px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Sip App Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>This app has a very nice interface and boasts a wonderful contrast checking feature, I found this feature most interesting and is probably my favourite feature of the app. Input two colors, and the checker will give you a score based on the relative contrast between those two colors.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.png"  alt="Check Contrast in Sip"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Check Contrast in Sip</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>If the contrast of your two colors gets a low score, you can quickly click on ‚ÄúFIX‚Äù and ‚Äî as the button name implies ‚Äî Sip will give you a new color of a similar hue that will increase the contrast for maximum legibility.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/1.1.png"  alt="Sip Magnifier and Color Name"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Sip Magnifier and Color Name</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<h2 id="aquarelo">Aquarelo</h2>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/aqua_icon.png"  alt="Aquarelo App Icon"   style="border-radius: 8px;  width: 256px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Aquarelo App Icon</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Moving onto Aquarelo, you can see the interface is very unique, highly minimalist and it reminds me of the color swatches you can pick up at the paint store.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/2.png"  alt="Aquarelo UI"   style="border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Aquarelo UI</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>I would say Aquarelo is the more elegant and beautifully designed of the two, but I think they serve slightly different audiences. I can see Aquarello being very good fit for interior or fashion designers, where you might need a range shades between two colors you have already chosen, whereas Sip perhaps caters more towards the experimental, promoting a freer spirit of mixing and matching.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/2.1.png"  alt="Aquarelo Pantone-esque"   style="border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Aquarelo Pantone-esque</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Both these apps allow you to export your palettes as HTML files. I put the same palette of colors into both apps and exported it as a demonstration. You can check out the results <a href="/palette_sip.html">here</a> (Sip) and <a href="/palette_aquarello.html">here</a> (Aquarelo). One thing to note is that both of these apps produced completely different names for the same colors, which might surprise you, but the names are really only used to add character to the colors, as opposed to being reliable indentifiers in and of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="cost-and-trials">Cost and Trials</h2>

<p>Costing $10 and $13 respectively, these color apps are useful and beautifully designed, and while I wouldn&rsquo;t consider them expensive, they are the most expensive of all the premium color pickers that I&rsquo;ve seen and it probably doesn&rsquo;t make sense to pay for one of these apps unless you know you&rsquo;ll be using it very regularly. To find out for yourself which you might like, it makes sense to download them and try for yourself - Sip has a free trial available from their site, Aquarelo does not, but you can trial both of these apps as part of <a href="https://setapp.com/">SetApp</a>. And while Aquarelo is available on the <a href="http://bit.ly/aquareloapp">Mac App Store</a>, Sip is not, available instead exclusively through their own homepage and SetApp. It was through SetApp that I trialled Aquarelo myself while I downloaded Sip as a trial directly from their homepage.</p>

<p>I mostly loved everything about both the apps but one complaint I would have about Sip is that I found the high frequency of their reminders to purchase their product and how many days were left of my trial to border on the obnoxious. Every time I logged into my Mac or woke up from sleep, I‚Äôd get a reminder. Sometimes I got these notifications for zero apparent reason, interrupting what I was doing. This got old very quickly and I deleted the app after a small number of days. That&rsquo;s quite a minor complaint though if I were actually using their app on a daily basis, like probably most of their target audience would be.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">Moving On</h2>

<p>In the end, I didn‚Äôt stick with either of these apps. I felt that they were a little beyond the scope of my needs. You might feel differently yourself because maybe you‚Äôre a professional full-time designer, or perhaps you work as part of a team or as a design lead, but I am not. I just need a simple way to pick a color every now and again. So in the end, I couldn‚Äôt really justify the cost, and I could do without yet-another icon in my [already-saturated] status bar.</p>

<p>Instead, I was reminded consistently of Apple‚Äôs own built-in Color Picker. This comes as standard in Mac OS X and is itself quite sophisticated. You will have seen it residing inside many other apps you use on a daily basis, such as Apple‚Äôs own software like Pages or Numbers. It should be noted that both Sip and Aquarelo give you an option to open up Apple&rsquo;s built-in color picker from within their respective apps. This is most important for Aquarelo, because it doesn&rsquo;t actually have it&rsquo;s own custom color picker tool.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/3.png"  alt="Apple&#39;s Color Picker"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Apple&#39;s Standard Color Picker</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Out of all the pickers I&rsquo;ve tested, this one is really my favourite one of all, because it‚Äôs a known quantity and it focuses purely on the task of picking and saving colors very efficiently and effectively. Not only that, it can be extended with extensions, like with this wonderful color picker extension that goes by the name of <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/skalacolor/">Skala Color</a>, made by one of my favourite software houses ‚Äì <a href="https://bjango.com/">Bjango</a>.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/4.png"  alt="Skala Color UI"   style="border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Skala Color UI</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>It too has the ability to export your colors in many formats, as you can see in the following screengrab.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/5.png"  alt="Skala Color Export Options"   style="border-radius: 8px; border-style: solid; border-width: 8px; border-color : #191926; background-color: #191926;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Skala Color Export Options</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>Skala Color has a really beautiful, high-precision color picker and does almost everything I need it to do, and the best part of all? It‚Äôs absolutely free.
I must say, Apple Color Picker with the Skala Color extension is really a fantastic combination and this would be my first recommendation to anyone who needs an exceedingly useful [<strong>free!</strong>] color picker for their development or designing needs. This combination is not really lacking in any way except for being slightly less intuitive than the paid apps, but in terms of functionality: it&rsquo;s all here. Personally, I don‚Äôt really mind just managing my palettes manually in the handy built-in color wells.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/6.png"  alt="Practically Limitless"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Practically Limitless</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>You can go a step further and create as many custom palettes as you want. Again, it&rsquo;s not as intuitive or beautiful as the paid apps, but it&rsquo;s more than sufficient. While I usually maintain my color palettes within design apps such as Sketch or Illustrator, it&rsquo;s certainly handy to have them in here so they can be called upon at any time.</p>


  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/6.1.png"  alt="Custom Palette"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Custom Palette</figcaption>
    
  </figure>



<p>To take it further again, you can download more color palettes and add them to Apple&rsquo;s Color Picker. What you need to look for are palette files which carry the <strong><code>.clr</code></strong> extension and put them into your <strong><code>~/Library/Colors</code></strong> folder. Then they will be available to you next time you open the color picker.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a complete set of Pantone Swatches in mine.

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="./img/6.2.png"  alt="Pantone Swatches"   style="border-radius: 8px;"  />
    
      <figcaption class="center"  style="color: white;" >Pantone Swatches</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

</p>

<p>These Pantone palette files were expertly crafted by Midwinter Duncan Grant and can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.midwinter-dg.com/resources.html#color-palettes">Resources page</a> of his site for free. Midwinter makes available a lot more free goodies beyond color palettes too, so be sure to check out his site <a href="http://www.midwinter-dg.com">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mapdiva.com/">Mapdiva</a> also have a list of <a href="https://www.mapdiva.com/artboard/artb-tutorial/12-custom-color-palettes-for-macos/">12 Custom Color Palettes</a> for you to download. I did find some of the links here broken, but it&rsquo;s a good article nonetheless.</p>

<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re specifically a coder and also have in interest in colors, I recommend you take a look at <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/">Ethan Schoonover&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized"><em>Solarized</em></a> project. This is a palette of only 16 colours, but they are highly refined, precise and tested extensively for contrast and legibility across many text editors and devices in a variety of lighting conditions. Basically, if you&rsquo;re a coder, you owe it to yourself [and your eyes] to check it out.</p>

<h2 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h2>

<p>So, Apple‚Äôs Color Picker with Bjango&rsquo;s Skala Color, that sounds like a real killer combo, right? Yes, but there is one major caveat: normally, you can only access Apple‚Äôs Color Picker within other apps and not as a standalone app that can be launched like any standard app.
This would seem to limit its function somewhat for picking colors when you‚Äôre browsing the Internet, for example. But fear not, you can easily turn Apple‚Äôs Color Picker into a standalone app that can be accessed and launched at any time, no matter what you‚Äôre doing!</p>

<p>This is done through a very simple AppleScript, made with Apple‚Äôs Script Editor, which you can find in the <code>Utilities</code> folder in your <code>~/Applications</code> directory. You can follow a very handy guide <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158">here</a> from <em>Mac OS X Hints</em> if you need further details, but should you want something even easier, I have gone ahead and made this handy app available for you to download for free. There are two version, one for speakers of British English, and the other in US-English. Just click download below to grab one.</p>
