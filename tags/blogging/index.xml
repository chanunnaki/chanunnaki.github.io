      <description>In this first part of a three-part series, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in setting up a simple blog like the one you&amp;rsquo;re on right now, and show you how to host it for free on Github Pages. When I began on this journey myself, I had close to zero experience with Github. I followed some of the available guides already out there on the web, (including those from Hugo themselves), but there were some parts that didnâ€™t quite click with me right away and it relied upon a lot of time and trial &amp;amp; error before it all finally worked.</description>
