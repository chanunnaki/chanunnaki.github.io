      <description>Tomorrow, the 21st of April 2019, marks the 30th anniversary of the launch of the original Nintendo Game Boy in Japan. The Game Boy was arguably technologically inferior to other portable handheld consoles released around that time such as the Atari Lynx and the Sega Game Gear, yet Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s Game Boy still managed to create and maintain a gigantic sales lead compared to the competition throughout it&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle.
