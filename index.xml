      <description>Wow, this one caught me by complete surprise. LineageOS &amp;ndash; an alternative free and open-source operating system for mobile devices &amp;ndash; have just officially released version 15.1 of their OS for the NVidia Shield Tablet K1.
LineageOS is a fork of the once-popular CyanogenMod and version 15.1 of the OS is based on Android 8.1 (Oreo)
Nvidia Shield Tablet K1  The Shield K1 is &amp;ndash; in my opinion &amp;ndash; one of the best Android tablets available.</description>

      <description>Wired just published an article with comments from Playstation lead system architect Mark Cerny.
 PlayStationâ€™s next-generation console ticks all those boxes, starting with an AMD chip at the heart of the device. (Warning: some alphabet soup follows.) The CPU is based on the third generation of AMDâ€™s Ryzen line and contains eight cores of the companyâ€™s new 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture. The GPU, a custom variant of Radeonâ€™s Navi family, will support ray tracing, a technique that models the travel of light to simulate complex interactions in 3D environments.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this three-part series, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in setting up a simple blog like the one you&amp;rsquo;re on right now, and show you how to host it for free on Github Pages. When I began on this journey myself, I had close to zero experience with Github. I followed some of the available guides already out there on the web, (including those from Hugo themselves), but there were some parts that didnâ€™t quite click with me right away and it relied upon a lot of time and trial &amp;amp; error before it all finally worked.</description>

      <description>The Terminal, (AKA CLI, or &amp;ldquo;Command-Line Interface&amp;rdquo;) is super-powerful and allows you to interface directly with the underlying workings of your operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty essential you learn how to use the Terminal if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be developing software or doing any more advanced operations within your operating system as many operations are done exclusively through the Terminal.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a quick run-down on how to navigate your file system in Terminal.</description>

      <description>A user going by the name &amp;ldquo;DerKoun&amp;rdquo; has submitted a post on the /r/emulation subreddit about a mod to popular cycle-accurate Super Nintendo emulator - BSNES - which makes it possible to increase the resolution of Mode 7 graphics by 4X. essentially turning classic SNES games into HD.
Mode 7 is the Super Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s built-in hardware-accelerated mathematical functions which allows for efficient rotation and scaling of sprites on the screen.</description>

      <description>In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light.
-Hans Hoffman
 Colorsâ€¦ they&amp;rsquo;re everywhere and all around us, and donâ€™t you just love them? When designing anything, colors are super important. The color of your fonts and UI elements can give your creations unique personality, character and drive attention towards different aspects of your design. Colors also give designers the ability to subtly draw a usersâ€™ focus to a desired element.</description>
